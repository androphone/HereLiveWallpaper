# Here Live Wallpaper
A live wallpaper that shows you the map of where you are. A cute, buggy project from last year.

## What API keys you may need:

* Google API keys for using Firebase
* MapBox API keys for getting maps
* whatever else screams it cannot access data

## Bugs:

* the app may crash because there's no location available (which it tries to handle but sometimes it can't)
* the app may crash after changing its settings for too many times
* the app may crash on your phone because it has only been tested on a single device
* the app may not compile because it relies on one-year-old dependencies
* the app may not compile because I don't know how the project will behave in case someone downloads it

## Things I learned from this project:
* interfaces exist
* some bugs just don't make sense

## Thing I learned from making this repo (tried 5 times):
* .gitignore doesn't always work as expected (thanks IDEA for revealing my API keys!)
